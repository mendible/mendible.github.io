I am currently a 4th year PhD student at the University of Washington in the Mechanical Engineering department. 

My work focuses on developing methods to improve reduced order models for systems with underlying symmetries. So far, I have developed an unsupervised, optimization-based method for improving dimensionality reduction methods when translations are present in the data. In the future, I endeavor to extend this method to higher dimensions. Additionally, I want to expand this work to include other symmetries such as rotations and scaling to apply to a wider class of problems. 

Please see my publications and talks for a closer look into my work.
